# Fun with Javascript

## Description
This Javascript-Practice repository contains a couple of javascript games including Rock, Paper, Scissor, and this week's challenge, the Password Generator.  A couple of others are in progress. These particular assignments provided experience in the javascript mindset of functions and their power. The use of the alert box to handle input and display messages is a good example of using user input variables within functions.  Recording the answers within an array displays a couple of the different functions of arrays from push to sum.

***Rock, Paper, Scissor***
Rock, Paper, Scissor is a game of chance involving 2 players and 3 variables.  When the game starts, the player is prompted for their choice, followed by the display of the computer's choice.  The two choices are compared to determine the winner.  The winning choices are:
1. R (rock) over Scissor
2. S (scissor) over Paper
3. P (paper) over Rock.

After the winner of that round is determined, a Win/Loss popup is populated and the player is asked if they want to continue.


***Password Generator - Class Challenge***
The user is prompted to answer the following questions as criteria for the creation of a random password:
    1. Length of the password
    2. What criteria to include:
       - Uppercase Letters
       - Lowercase Letters
       - Special Characters
       - Numbers
       
If a user enters an invalid choice, they are asked the same question until a valid choice.  The questions are asked through window prompts through the user's browser.

A reset button was added so that the array choices for the creation of the password could be cleared since the array has been set as a global variable.
