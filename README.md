# javascript-practice

## Description
This Javascript-Practice repository contains a couple of javascript games including Rock, Paper, Scissor, a Powerball Game example, some of the algorithm examples and of course the Javascript challege module from week three.  These particular assignments put us in the javascript mindset of functions and tap on one's understanding of their power. The use of the alert box to handle input and display messages is a good example of using variables within our functions.  Recording the answers within an array displays a couple of the different functions of arrays from push to sum.
